# Student Management Application

This application provides a RESTful API for managing student records. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.

## Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK):Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed (e.g., Java 11 or later).
Maven:** This project uses Maven for building and dependency management. Install Maven if you haven't already.
A REST Client: You'll need a tool to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints (e.g., Postman, Insomnia, curl).

## How to Build the Application

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd student-management-application
    ```
    *(Replace `student-management-application` with the actual name of your project directory)*

2.  **Build the application using Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will download dependencies, compile the code, and package the application into an executable JAR file. The JAR file will be created in the `target` directory.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Navigate to the `target` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd target
    ```

2.  **Run the application using the generated JAR file:**
    ```bash
    java -jar student-management-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    *(The filename might vary slightly depending on your project's version)*

    The application will start, and you should see logs indicating that the Spring Boot server has started (typically on port 8080).

## Instruction for Accessing the H2 Database Console

This application likely uses an embedded H2 database for development purposes. You can access the H2 database console to view and manage the data directly.

1.  **Ensure the application is running.**

2.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the H2 console URL. The default URL is usually:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/h2-console
    ```

3.  **Login Configuration:** You might need to provide the following connection details:
    * **JDBC URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` (This is a common default for in-memory H2 databases in Spring Boot)
    * **User Name:** `sa` (This is a common default)
    * **Password:** Leave it blank (unless you have configured a password)

4.  **Click the "Connect" button.**

You should now have access to the H2 database console, where you can execute SQL queries, view tables, and inspect the data.

**Note:** The H2 database console is typically enabled for development profiles. It might be disabled in production environments for security reasons. You might need to configure properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file to enable or customize the H2 console. For example:

```properties
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
